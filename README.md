# 📅 St. Paul's University Event Hub

**Event Hub** is a web-based platform designed to centralize event management and discovery at St. Paul's University. It bridges the gap between student organizers and the student body, replacing scattered WhatsApp messages and physical notice boards with a single, reliable digital feed.

## 🚀 The Problem
Currently, event information at St. Paul's is fragmented across notice boards, various social media groups, and word-of-mouth. This leads to:
* **Low Awareness:** Students miss events simply because they didn't see the poster.
* **Clutter:** Important announcements get buried in WhatsApp chats.
* **Inefficiency:** Organizers struggle to reach students outside their specific departments.

## 💡 The Solution
Event Hub provides a "Single Source of Truth" for campus activities.
* **For Students:** A clean, searchable feed of all upcoming workshops, sports days, and club meetups.
* **For Organizers:** A simple dashboard to create and publish events instantly.
* **For Administration:** Better visibility into campus engagement and student activities.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
This project is built using the **MEN Stack** (MongoDB, Express, Node.js) with a native implementation for the frontend to ensure performance and simplicity.

* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript (No heavy frameworks).
* **Backend:** Node.js & Express.js (RESTful API).
* **Database:** MongoDB (NoSQL database for flexible event data).

##  ✨ Key Features
* **Event Feed:** Real-time list of upcoming campus events.
* **Categorization:** Filter events by "Academic", "Entertainment", "Sports", etc.
* **Organizer Dashboard:** Secure login for club leaders to post new events.
* **Responsive Design:** Works seamlessly on mobile phones and laptops.
